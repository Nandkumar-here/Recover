# ðŸ§¾ Recover

**Recover** is a program that scans a raw memory card file (e.g., `.raw`) and **recovers deleted JPEG images** by detecting JPEG file signatures and extracting the image data.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Reads the raw memory card data in 512-byte blocks
- Detects the start of a JPEG file based on signature:  
0xff 0xd8 0xff 0xe0 - 0xef  
- When a new JPEG is found:
- Closes the previous file (if any)
- Starts writing to a new JPEG file (e.g., `000.jpg`, `001.jpg`, etc.)
- Continues until all JPEGs are recovered

$ make recover
$ ./recover memorycard.raw
